### Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Node.js (version 12 or higher): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-backend-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-frontend-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   This command will compile and run the Angular application. You should see a message indicating that the application is running and the URL where you can access it (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`).

### Accessing the Application
Once both the backend server and frontend development server are running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:4200` (or the appropriate URL displayed in the frontend development server's output).

That's it! You should now have both the backend and frontend servers up and running locally, and you can begin interacting with your application.
